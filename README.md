Homework #1: Controlling RGB LED
</summary>

## Controlling RGB LED :rotating_light:

### Components
* Arduino Uno
* RGB LED 
* Potentiometers
* Resistors and wires

### Technical Task

* Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

### Setup

:exclamation: The configuration described below corresponds to an RGB LED with a common cathode.

Homework #2: Simulating Elevator
</summary>

# Elevator Simulator :arrow_up: :arrow_down:

## Description

For this project, I implemented a 3-floor elevator control system simulation using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with an Arduino Uno board. The objective was to create a realistic representation of an elevator control system. This involved utilizing various components and coding to achieve the desired functionality.


## Components

- Arduino Uno
- LEDs (3)
- RGB LED
- Buttons (3)
- Buzzer
- Resistors and wires

## Technical Task

- Design a control system that simulates a 3-floor elevator using the Arduino platform. Here are the specific requirements:

- **LED Indicators:** Each of the 3 LEDs should represent one of the 3 floors. The LED corresponding to the current floor should light up. Additionally, another LED should represent the elevator's operational state. It should blink when the elevator is moving and remain static when stationary.

- **Buttons:** Implement 3 buttons that represent the call buttons from the 3 floors. When pressed, the elevator should simulate movement towards the floor after a short interval (2-3 seconds).

- **Buzzer:** The buzzer should sound briefly during the following scenarios:
  - Elevator arriving at the desired floor (something resembling a "cling").
  - Elevator doors closing and movement.

- **State Change & Timers:** If the elevator is already at the desired floor, pressing the button for that floor should have no effect. Otherwise, after a button press, the elevator should "wait for the doors to close" and then "move" to the corresponding floor. If the elevator is in movement, it should either do nothing or it should stack its decision (get to the first programmed floor, open the doors, wait, close them, and then go to the next desired floor).

- **Debounce:** Remember to implement debounce for the buttons to avoid unintentional repeated button presses.
