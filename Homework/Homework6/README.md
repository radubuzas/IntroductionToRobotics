# Mini 8x8 LED Matrix Game :video_game:

## Description

Welcome to Tank Battle, an exciting game where you take on the role of a tank commander on a mission to destroy all the hardened walls on a dynamic battlefield. The game starts with a cheerful greeting message displayed on the 8x8 LED matrix. If you're eager to jump into action, a quick press of the joystick button skips the greeting message, getting you straight into the game.

### Gameplay

- **Map Generation:**
  - A random map is generated with static LEDs representing hard walls.
  - A tank (slow blinking LED) is also randomly placed on the battlefield.

- **Objective:**
  - Your mission is to strategically maneuver the tank to destroy all the walls.

- **Tank Controls:**
  - Use the joystick for smooth and responsive control over the tank's movements.
  - The tank is distinguishable by its slow-blinking LED.

- **Bullet Destruction:**
  - Press the joystick button to fire a fast-blinking LED bullet.
  - If the bullet reaches a wall, the wall will be destroyed.

- **Winning the Game:**
  - Once all the walls are successfully destroyed, a heart symbol will be displayed on the LED matrix.
  - Congratulations, you've won the Tank Battle!
  - After winning the game, you can press the joystick to activate a new round
