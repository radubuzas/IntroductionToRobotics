# Controlling RGB LED :rotating_light:

## Components
* Arduino Uno
* RGB LED 
* Potentiometers
* Resistors and wires

## Technical Task

* Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

## Setup

:exclamation: The configuration described below corresponds to an RGB LED with a common cathode.
